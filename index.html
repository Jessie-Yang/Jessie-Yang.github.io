<p>Identifying the factors  that influence taxi demand is very important for understanding where and when  people use taxis. A large set of Global Positioning System (GPS) data from New  York City (NYC) taxis is used along with demographic, socioeconomic, and employment  data to identify the factors that drive taxi demand. The taxi data is categorized  by pick-ups and drop-offs at different times of day to help understand how taxi demand changes by day of time. The visulazation of the taxi pick-ups and drop-offs are shown below. A multiple linear  regression model is estimated for each hour of the day to model pick-ups and  another to model drop-offs....</p>
